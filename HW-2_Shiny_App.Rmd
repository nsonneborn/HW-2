## ggplot movies

 * Plots budget on the x-axis and rating on the y-axis
 * Instead of having a radio button to select the genre of movie (`Action`,
 `Animation`, `Comedy`, etc), have a radio button that allows you to toggle 
 between comedies and non-comedies. This app should be simpler.

```{r eruptions, echo=FALSE}
inputPanel(
  # Input genre
  radioButtons(inputId = "genre", label = "Genre", 
              choices = list("comedy" = 1, "non comedies" = 0))
)

renderPlot({

  # Generate Plots
  genre <- movies %>% filter(Comedy == input$genre)
  ggplot(data=genre, aes(x=budget, y=rating)) + 
    geom_point()
})

```
